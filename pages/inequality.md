title: Reduce inequality within and among countries
goalNum: 10
name: Reduced Inequalities
description: >-
  The international community has made significant strides towards lifting
  people out of poverty.  The most vulnerable nations – the least developed
  countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing
  states – continue to make inroads into poverty reduction.  However, inequality
  still persists and large disparities remain in access to health and education
  services and other assets.

## Target 10.1

_**By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average.**_

Economic growth in low-income countries is essential to attaining SDG1: ending global poverty. However, average gross domestic product (GDP) can fail to capture the large inequalities in growth across the distribution. To reduce poverty, those at the bottom of the distribution must growth as much as (if not more) than elsewhere across the spectrum. In the chart below we see the annual average growth rate per capita of income/consumption in the bottom 40 percent of the population.

## Target 10.4

**_Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality._**

## **Target 10.6**

_**Ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions.**_

## Target 10.a

**_Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries._**

## **Target 10.b**

**_Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is greatest._**

Global inequalities have the potential to be reduced through the transfer of finance from higher-income to lower-income countries. In the chart below we see the net official development assistance (ODA) and aid lower-to-middle income countries receive from all donors.

## **Target 10.c**

**_By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent._**
