title: Reduce inequality within and among countries
goalNum: 10
name: Reduced Inequalities
description: >-
  The international community has made significant strides towards lifting
  people out of poverty.  The most vulnerable nations – the least developed
  countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing
  states – continue to make inroads into poverty reduction.  However, inequality
  still persists and large disparities remain in access to health and education
  services and other assets.
