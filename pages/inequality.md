title: Reduce inequality within and among countries
goalNum: 10
name: Reduced Inequalities
description: >-
  The international community has made significant strides towards lifting
  people out of poverty.  The most vulnerable nations – the least developed
  countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing
  states – continue to make inroads into poverty reduction.  However, inequality
  still persists and large disparities remain in access to health and education
  services and other assets.


  Further statistics, analysis and visuals on inequality can be found at <i>Our
  World in Data</i> entries on [Income
  Inequality](https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality), [Incomes across the
  Distribution](https://ourworldindata.org/incomes-across-the-distribution) and
  [Global Economic
  Inequality](https://ourworldindata.org/global-economic-inequality).


  The UN has defined 10 "Targets" and 11 "Indicators" for SDG 10. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
