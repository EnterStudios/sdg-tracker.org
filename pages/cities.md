  The challenges cities face can be overcome in ways that allow them to continue
  to thrive and grow, while improving resource use and reducing pollution and
  poverty. The future we want includes cities of opportunities for all, with
  access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation and more.

## **Target 11.1**

_**By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.**_

Over the past few decades we [have seen](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/urban-and-rural-population) a significant shift in populations from rural to urban areas; 2007 was the year in which more people across the world lived in urban areas than in rural. However, urban living does not guarantee safe or adequate housing. The chart below shows the share of urban populations across the world which live in slum housing.
