goalNum: 11
name: Sustainable Cities and Communities
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cities/):
  <i><q>The challenges cities face can be overcome in ways that allow them to
  continue to thrive and grow, while improving resource use and reducing
  pollution and poverty. The future we want includes cities of opportunities for
  all, with access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation and
  more.</q></i>


  The UN has defined 10 _Targets_ and 15 _Indicators_ for SDG 11. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all <i>Targets</i> and show the data on the agreed <i>Indicators</i>.
