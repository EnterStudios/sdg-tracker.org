  The challenges cities face can be overcome in ways that allow them to continue
  to thrive and grow, while improving resource use and reducing pollution and
  poverty. The future we want includes cities of opportunities for all, with
  access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation and more.

## **Target 11.1**

**By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.**

Over the past few decades we [have seen](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/urban-and-rural-population) a significant shift in populations from rural to urban areas; 2007 was the year in which more people across the world lived in urban areas than in rural. However, urban living does not guarantee safe or adequate housing. The chart below shows the share of urban populations across the world which live in slum housing.

## Target 11.5

**By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters.**

Natural disasters are often volatile, unpredictable and therefore difficult to protect against. However, there are a number of steps and contingencies (ranging from early warning systems to specialised building regulations) which can mitigate against damage from such events.

The charts below show the annual damage from natural disasters in terms of deaths, death rates, displacement and direct economic losses across the world. Further statistics and visualisations on these trends can be found at our entry on [Natural Catastrophes](https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes).

## Target 11.6

**By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.**

As urban populations expand, and infrastructure within cities develops, it's crucial that they can operate as safe and healthy environments to live and work in. This includes the minimisation of air pollution, water pollution and municipal and toxic wastes.

The charts below provide data on levels of air pollution and waste across the world. Further statistics and visualisations can be found at our entries on [Air Pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution) and [Indoor Air Pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution).

## Target 11.b

**By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards climate change mitigation, adaptation, and disaster management plans.**

Building resilience to natural disasters requires integrated policies at international, national and sub-national levels - particularly within cities with dense populations and vulnerable infrastructure. The chart below shows the number of countries with legislative or regulatory provisions for managing disaster risks.
