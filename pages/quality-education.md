description: >-
  Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving peopleâ€™s lives
  and sustainable development. Major progress has been made towards increasing
  access to education at all levels and increasing enrolment rates in schools
  particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills have improved
  tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for
  achieving universal education goals. For example, the world has achieved
  equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have
  achieved that target at all levels of education.

## Target 4.1

_**By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.**_

A pre-requisite for assessing whether children achieve relevant and expected learning outcomes is the existence of nationally representative learning assessments. The chart below shows whether each country has a nationally representative learning assessment at the end of primary education.

The charts below show the share of students at the end of primary education who achieve at least a minimum proficiency in reading, and mathematics.

## Target 4.2

_**By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education. **_

The charts below show the share of children of pre-primary age who are enroled in pre-primary education. This is given as the total across both sexes, with a further comparison of enrolment rates between boys and girls.

## Target 4.6

_**By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.**_

The charts below show the share of the population who can both read and write with understanding of a short statement on their everyday life. In most cases 'literacy' also includes 'numeracy', which is the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations.
