  Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving peopleâ€™s lives
  and sustainable development. Major progress has been made towards increasing
  access to education at all levels and increasing enrolment rates in schools
  particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills have improved
  tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for
  achieving universal education goals. For example, the world has achieved
  equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have
  achieved that target at all levels of education.
