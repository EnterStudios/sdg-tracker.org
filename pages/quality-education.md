title: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning
goalNum: 4
name: Quality Education
description: >-
  Obtaining a quality education underpins a range of fundamental development
  drivers. Major progress has been made towards increasing access to education
  at all levels, particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills across
  the world have improved tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to achieve
  universal education goals for all. For example, the world has achieved
  equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have
  achieved that target at all levels of education.


  The charts and visuals below provide data on the major developments in global
  education in relation to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets.
  Further information on education and learning can be found across a range of
  _Our World in Data_ entries on the [Global Rise of
  Education](https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education);
