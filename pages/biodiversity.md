  Forests cover 30 per cent of the Earthâ€™s surface and in addition to providing
  food security and shelter, forests are key to combating climate change,
  protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population.  Thirteen
  million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent
  degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion
  hectares.

## Target 15.1

_**By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.**_

The charts below provide data across the world on forested land cover (given as a share of total land area) and the prevalence of terrestrially-protected areas.

## Target 15.2

**_By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally._**

## Target 15.4

**_By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity._**

## Target 15.5

**_Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species._**

## Target 15.a

**_Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems._**

## Target 15.b

**_Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management._**
