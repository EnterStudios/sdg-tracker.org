  Forests cover 30 per cent of the Earthâ€™s surface and in addition to providing
  food security and shelter, forests are key to combating climate change,
  protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population.  Thirteen
  million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent
  degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion
  hectares.
