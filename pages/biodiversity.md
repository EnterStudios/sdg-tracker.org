  Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land
  degradation, halt biodiversity loss

name: Life on Land
description: >-
  Forests cover 30 per cent of the Earthâ€™s surface and in addition to providing
  food security and shelter, forests are key to combating climate change,
  protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population.  Thirteen
  million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent
  degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion
  hectares.


  The UN has defined 12 "Targets" and 14 "Indicators" for SDG 15. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.

    <h2>Target 15.1: Conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems</h2>
    <p>UN definition: <q>By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.</q></p>
    <p>SDG Indicators: <br><a href="#15.1.1">15.1.1 Forest area as a proportion of total land area</a> <br><a href="#15.1.2">15.1.2 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type</a></p>

            <h3>Forest area</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Indicator 15.1.1 is <i><q>Forest area as a proportion of total land area</q></i>.<p>Forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees of at least 5 meters in situ, whether productive or not, and excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems (for example, in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) and trees in urban parks and gardens.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <i><q>By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services</q></i>. <p>Unlike most SDGs which have a target year of 2030, this indicator is set to be achieved by 2020.</p>
