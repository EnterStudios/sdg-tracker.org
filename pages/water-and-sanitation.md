description: >-
  Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to
  live in. There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. But
  due to bad economics or poor infrastructure, every year millions of people,
  most of them children, die from diseases associated with inadequate water
  supply, sanitation and hygiene.
