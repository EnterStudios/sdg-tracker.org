title: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all
goalNum: 6
name: Clean Water and Sanitation
description: >-
  Clean water is a basic human need, and one that should be easily accessible to
  all. There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. However,
  due to poor infrastructure, investment and planning, every year millions of
  people — [most of them
  children](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-by-risk-under5s) — die
  from [diseases associated
  with](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-diarrheal-diseases-by-age)
  inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene.


  The charts below summarise progress towards improved water and sanitation
  access. More details on Water Access, Resources and Sanitation can be found at
  the _Our World in Data_ entry
  [here](https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation).


  The UN has defined 8 "Targets" and 11 "Indicators" for SDG 6. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
