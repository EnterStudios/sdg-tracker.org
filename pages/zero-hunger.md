  End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
  sustainable agriculture
goalNum: 2

description: >-
  Food and nutrition is a basic requirement for health and wellbeing. Whilst
  globally we produce more than enough food for today's population, [815 million
  people remained
  undernourished](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-population-defined-as-undernourished)
  in 2016. 


  Improving nutrition extends beyond basic caloric needs and incorporates all
  forms of malnutrition including [childhood wasting,
  stunting](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#undernourishment-of-children),
  micronutrient deficiencies (particularly in children, pregnant and lactating
  women), and obesity. Malnutrition is therefore highly relevant to all
  countries.


  You can find many more visuals and statistics on [hunger and
  undernourishment](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment),
  [micronutrient
  deficiencies](https://ourworldindata.org/micronutrient-deficiency) and
  [obesity](https://ourworldindata.org/obesity) at the _Our World in Data_
  entries on these topics. Our entries on
  [famines](https://ourworldindata.org/famines), [food per
  person](https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person), and [diet
  compositions](https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions) also tie closely
  to these topics.


  The UN has defined 8 _Targets_ and 13 _Indicators_ for SDG 2. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.

            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Indicator 2.1.1 is the <i><q>prevalence of undernourishment</q></i>. <p>The prevalence of undernourishment is the share of the population with a caloric intake which is insufficient to meet minimum requirements for a healthy life. Minimum requirements vary by individual based on age, gender, weight, activity levels and so vary by country depending on the demographics of its population. Distributions for individuals are taken into account for this measure.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <i><q>End hunger</q></i> by 2030. This means eliminating undernourishment for all.</p>
