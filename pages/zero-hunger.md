  Food and nutrition is a basic requirement for health and wellbeing. Whilst
  globally we produce more than enough food for today's population, [815 million
  people remained
  undernourished](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-population-defined-as-undernourished)
  in 2016. 


  Improving nutrition extends beyond basic caloric needs and incorporates all
  forms of malnutrition including [childhood wasting,
  stunting](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#undernourishment-of-children),
  micronutrient deficiencies (particularly in children, pregnant and lactating
  women), and obesity. Malnutrition is therefore highly relevant to all
  countries.


  You can find many more visuals and statistics on [hunger and
  undernourishment](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment),
  [micronutrient
  deficiencies](https://ourworldindata.org/micronutrient-deficiency) and
  [obesity](https://ourworldindata.org/obesity) at the _Our World in Data_
  entries on these topics. Our entries on
  [famines](https://ourworldindata.org/famines), [food per
  person](https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person), and [diet
  compositions](https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions) also tie closely
  to these topics.
