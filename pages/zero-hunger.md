  Food and nutrition is a basic requirement for health and wellbeing. Whilst
  globally we produce more than enough food for today's population, [815 million
  people remained
  undernourished](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-population-defined-as-undernourished)
  in 2016. 


  Improving nutrition extends beyond basic caloric needs and incorporates all
  forms of malnutrition including [childhood wasting,
  stunting](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#undernourishment-of-children),
  micronutrient deficiencies (particularly in children, pregnant and lactating
  women), and obesity. Malnutrition is therefore highly relevant to all
  countries.


  You can find many more visuals and statistics on [hunger and
  undernourishment](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment),
  [micronutrient
  deficiencies](https://ourworldindata.org/micronutrient-deficiency) and
  [obesity](https://ourworldindata.org/obesity) at our full entries on these
  topics. Our entries on [famines](https://ourworldindata.org/famines), [food
  per person](https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person), and [diet
  compositions](https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions) also tie closely
  to these topics.

## Target 2.1

**_By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round._**

The chart below shows the share of the total population defined as undernourished. This is defined as the share of the population which fall below the defined minimum level of dietary energy (caloric) consumption. Data therefore refers to the percentage of the population whose food intake is insufficient to consistently meet dietary energy requirements.

Data for high-income countries where the prevalence of undernourishment is below 5% is not included.

## **Target 2.2**

**_By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons._**

Malnutrition in children can arise in several forms — two of the main indicators of childhood development and nutrition is 'stunting' and 'wasting'.  The share of children (under 5 years old) defined as stunted or wasted are shown in the two charts below.

'Stunting' (too little height-for-age) refers to children with a height which falls more than two standard deviations below the median height-for-age of the WHO Child Growth Standards. 'Wasting' (too low weight-for-height) refers to to children with a weight-for-height which falls more than two standard deviations below the median for international reference population.

Adequate nutrition in adolescent, pregnant and lactating women can have a significant impact on health outcomes not only for women's health but also a child's nutritional and health outcomes. Micronutrient deficiencies — in particular anemia and vitamin-A deficiency in women and children — is an important indicator of nutritional quality.

The charts below show the share of pregnant women, women of reproductive age, and children suffering from anemia, followed by the share of women and children suffering from vitamin-A deficiency (which can result in symptoms including night blindness). 

**Prevalence of anemia**

**_Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility._**
