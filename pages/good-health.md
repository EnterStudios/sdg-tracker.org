title: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
goalNum: 3
name: Good Health and Well-Being
description: >-
  Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages is
  essential to sustainable development. Significant strides have been made in
  increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated
  with child and maternal mortality. Major progress has been made on increasing
  access to clean water and sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio
  and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, many more efforts are needed to fully
  eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and
  emerging health issues.

## Target 3.1: By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births

        <h3 id="3.1.1">3.1.1 Maternal mortality ratio</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The maternal mortality ratio refers to the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.</p>
        <p><strong>More research:</strong> Country-level data on the number of maternal deaths can be found here, Data on Maternal Mortality can be found at our full entry, available here.</p>
        <p>The Our World in Data entry on maternal mortality visualizes data to give a long-run perspective over the last centuries and the presents research on the causes and consequences of the deaths of mothers.</p>

        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The percentage of births attended by personnel trained to give the necessary supervision, care, and advice to women during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period; to conduct deliveries on their own; and to care for newborns.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> There is no goal specified for the share of births birth attended by skilled staff. It is presumably included as an indicator because skilled staff can reduce maternal mortality as we show in our entry on maternal mortality.</p>

## Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.
SDG indicators: 3.2.1 Under-5 mortality rate & 3.2.2 Neonatal mortality rate

        <h3>3.2.1 Under-5 mortality rate</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The under-5 mortality rate measures the number of children who die before their 5th birthday, per 1,000 live births.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Reduce child mortality to less than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births.</p>
        <p><strong>More research:</strong> Child mortality is covered more broadly, and with a longer-term perspective in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-health">Global Health</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Goal:</strong>The goal is to reduce to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births.</p>
