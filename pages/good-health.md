title: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
goalNum: 3
name: Good Health and Well-Being
description: >-
  Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages is
  essential to sustainable development. Significant strides have been made in
  increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated
  with child and maternal mortality. Major progress has been made on increasing
  access to clean water and sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio
  and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, many more efforts are needed to fully
  eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and
  emerging health issues.
