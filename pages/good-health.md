title: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
goalNum: 3
name: Good Health and Well-Being
description: >-
  Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages is
  essential to sustainable development. Significant strides have been made in
  increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated
  with child and maternal mortality. Major progress has been made on increasing
  access to clean water and sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio
  and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, many more efforts are needed to fully
  eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and
  emerging health issues.

## Target 3.1

_**By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.**_

Maternal mortality is defined as number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The charts below present global-level data on maternal mortality rates, and the absolute number of maternal deaths per year. Country-level data on the number of maternal deaths can be found <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-maternal-deaths?country=BGD+BRA+COD+IND+ZAF+OWID_WRL+ZMB">here</a>, and additional data on Maternal Mortality can be found at our full entry, available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/">here</a>.

**Percentage of births attended by trained personnel**

The provision of adequate healthcare and support by medical staff can be an important driver in reducing maternal and newborn mortality rates. The chart below shows the percentage of births who were attended by personnel trained to give necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour (or guidence on how to conduct deliveries on their own) and postpartum period.

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/births-attended-by-health-staff" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

## Target 3.2

_**By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.**_

**Neonatal mortality (newborns under 28 days of age)**

Neonatal mortality is defined as the share of newborns who die before reaching 28 days of age, measured per 1,000 live births in a given year. The charts below show the neonatal mortality rate, followed by the breakdown of total neonatal deaths by region.

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/neonatal-mortality-WDI" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe><iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-neonatal-deaths-by-region" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

**Child mortality (children under 5 years old)**

Child mortality is defined as the number of children who die before reaching their 5th birthday. This is measured as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. In the charts below we see the child mortality rate by country over time; the comparison of child mortality rates between boys and girls; and the total number of child deaths per year differentiated by region.

Child mortality is covered more broadly, and with a longer-term perspective in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta/#child-mortality">Global Health</a>.

## Target 3.4

**_By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being._**

**Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)**

The chart below shows the percentage of 30-year-olds who would die before their 70th birthday (defined as premature) from any non-communicable disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease. This assumes they would not die from any other cause of death, such as injuries or HIV/AIDS.

**Mental wellbeing**

The visualisation below presents global-level data on suicide mortality rates (per 100,000 people). More in-depth data on suicide, its correlates and determinants are available at our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/suicide/">full entry</a>. Also shown is the share of the total population suffering from depression, which refers to the sum of those suffering from 'major depressive disorder' and 'persistent depressive disorder'.

## Target 3.5

_**Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol.**_

Recorded alcohol per capita (for those aged 15+) consumption of pure alcohol is calculated as the sum of beverage specific
 alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other) from different sources. The average pure alcohol consumption per capita per year is shown in the chart below.

Also detailed below are the share of the population suffering from drug use and alcohol use disorders. Drug dependence is defined by the International Classification of Diseases as the presence of three or more indicators of dependence for at least a month within the previous year. Such indicators are detailed in the charts below.

## Target 3.7

_**By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.**_

Access to modern methods of family planning, and sexual health services has an important influence on fertility rate, gender equality, education and social outcomes. The charts below show the percentage of married women (aged 15-49) whose need for family planning is satisfied with modern methods; and the adolescent/teenage pregnancy rate which is measured as the number of births per 1000 women aged 15-19. 

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/demand-for-family-planning" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe><iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/adolescent-birth-rate" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

## Target 3.8

_**Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.**_

The charts below detail the access, quality and affordability of healthcare for all. Below we see the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) index, measured on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). This index is based on death rates from 32 causes of death which could be preventable with timely and adequate healthcare. Also shown is the share of healthcare expenditure which is out-of-pocket by households and individuals, and the share of the population at risk of catastrophic or impoverishing expenditure if they were to require surgical care.
