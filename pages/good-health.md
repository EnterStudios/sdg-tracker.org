description: >-
  Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages is
  essential to sustainable development. Significant strides have been made in
  increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated
  with child and maternal mortality. Major progress has been made on increasing
  access to clean water and sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio
  and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, many more efforts are needed to fully
  eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and
  emerging health issues.

## Target 3.1

_**By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.**_

Maternal mortality is defined as number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The charts below present global-level data on maternal mortality rates, and the absolute number of maternal deaths per year. Country-level data on the number of maternal deaths can be found <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-maternal-deaths?country=BGD+BRA+COD+IND+ZAF+OWID_WRL+ZMB">here</a>, and additional data on Maternal Mortality can be found at our full entry, available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/">here</a>.

**Percentage of births attended by trained personnel**

The provision of adequate healthcare and support by medical staff can be an important driver in reducing maternal and newborn mortality rates. The chart below shows the percentage of births who were attended by personnel trained to give necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour (or guidence on how to conduct deliveries on their own) and postpartum period.

## Target 3.2

_**By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.**_

**Neonatal mortality (newborns under 28 days of age)**

Neonatal mortality is defined as the share of newborns who die before reaching 28 days of age, measured per 1,000 live births in a given year. The charts below show the neonatal mortality rate, followed by the breakdown of total neonatal deaths by region.

**Child mortality (children under 5 years old)**

Child mortality is defined as the number of children who die before reaching their 5th birthday. This is measured as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. In the charts below we see the child mortality rate by country over time; the comparison of child mortality rates between boys and girls; and the total number of child deaths per year differentiated by region.

Child mortality is covered more broadly, and with a longer-term perspective in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta/#child-mortality">Global Health</a>.

## Target 3.3

_**By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases.**_

The charts below provide data on the incidence, as well as the number of annual deaths related to communicable diseases. Broader and long-term coverage is available on some of these health issues at our entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids/">HIV/AIDS</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria/">Malaria</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death/">Causes of Death</a>.

**HIV/AIDS**

## Target 3.4

**_By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being._**

**Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)**

The chart below shows the percentage of 30-year-olds who would die before their 70th birthday (defined as premature) from any non-communicable disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease. This assumes they would not die from any other cause of death, such as injuries or HIV/AIDS.

**Mental wellbeing**

The visualisation below presents global-level data on suicide mortality rates (per 100,000 people). More in-depth data on suicide, its correlates and determinants are available at our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/suicide/">full entry</a>.

## Target 3.6

_**By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.**_

The charts below provide data on death rates (measured as the number of deaths per 100,000) from road accidents, and the breakdown of total road accident deaths by motor vehicle, pedestrians, motorcyclists and cyclists. More information on road-related deaths can be found in our entry on [Causes of Death](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#road-accidents).

## Target 3.7

_**By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.**_

Access to modern methods of family planning, and sexual health services has an important influence on fertility rate, gender equality, education and social outcomes. The charts below show the percentage of married women (aged 15-49) whose need for family planning is satisfied with modern methods; and the adolescent/teenage pregnancy rate which is measured as the number of births per 1000 women aged 15-19.

## Target 3.8

**_By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination._**

The visualisations below present a global-level perspective of mortality rates related to household and ambient (outdoor) air pollution. These topics are covered in detail in our entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution/">Air Pollution</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution/">Indoor Air Pollution</a>.

## Target 3.a

**_Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control._**

The charts below provide a global overview of the prevalence of smoking in people aged 15 years and older, by gender. We cover the topic of smoking — including attributable deaths and secondhand smoke — in our entry available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smoking/">here</a>.

## Target 3.b

**_Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and non‑communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines._**

Vaccinations have greatly reduced the prevalence of diseases and they continue to be important for global health today. In the charts below we see the share of children (aged 12-23 months) who received the DPT3 (for Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) and measles vaccine. More information on vaccination can be found at our full entry [here](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination).
