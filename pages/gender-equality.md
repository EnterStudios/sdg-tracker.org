## Target 5.1

**_End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere._**

The following visualisations present global-level data on the legal basis of nondiscrimation and gender equality across various measures, including hiring, equal pay, marital rape and property rights, among others. Also shown below is the long-term global progression of universal suffrage — an important indicator of gender equality.

## Target 5.3

**_Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation._**

The map below presents coverage of the percentage of women (aged between 20 and 24) who report being married or in a union before the age of 18. This metric for some countries is typically more consistently measured/estimated providing a useful time-series trend. However for some countries, measurement is still a key issue; data for India and Brazil, for example, has not been recorded within the last decade.

## Target 5.5

**_Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decisionmaking in political, economic and public life._**

The series of charts below present data on political participation and management positions held by women at various levels. Data coverage on political participation is typically complete and up-to-date for nearly all countries, however, data on female management is less well-covered.

## Target 5.6

**_Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences._**

This chart shows the percentage of interviewed, married women aged 15-49 who report making their own informed decisions on healthcare-related issues. As is the case with many gender-related metrics, data for many countries is infrequently reported and often insufficient to develop trends over time.
