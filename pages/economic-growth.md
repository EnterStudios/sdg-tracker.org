name: Decent Work and Economic Growth
description: >-
  Roughly half the world’s population still lives on the equivalent of about
  US$2 a day. And in too many places, having a job doesn’t guarantee the ability
  to escape from poverty. This slow and uneven progress requires us to rethink
  and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty.
