name: Decent Work and Economic Growth
description: >-
  Roughly half the world’s population still lives on the equivalent of about
  US$2 a day. And in too many places, having a job doesn’t guarantee the ability
  to escape from poverty. This slow and uneven progress requires us to rethink
  and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty.

## Target 8.1

_**Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries.**_

The chart below shows the annual growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Further data and statistics can be found in our entry on [Economic Growth](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth).

## Target 8.5

_**By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.**_

Achieving full and productive employment entails two key components: low levels of unemployment and good hourly earnings. Trends in these two parameters are shown in charts below, differentiated by sex.

## Target 8.6

_**By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training.**_

The unemployment rate within young demographics in some countries remains high. Promoting the inclusion of youth within the labour force through further education, training or employment will be crucial in improving such trends. The chart below shows the share of youth (aged 15-29) who are not in education, employment or training (NEET).

## Target 8.7

_**Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.**_
