## Target 16.2

**_End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children._**

Violations of children's rights — including violence and child labour — in addition to human trafficking remain tragically common across the world. The visuals below show rates of childhood violence, labour, sexual abuse and human trafficking across the world.

## Target 16.5

_**Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.**_

Corruption is an issue imposing political, economic, and environmental costs to societies around the world. The effective functioning of institutions and political systems requires the development of trust and in transparent governance. 

The illegal nature of corruption makes [data collection and availability](https://ourworldindata.org/corruption#definitions-measurement-and-data-quality) difficult. Below we present global trends in bribery incidence. Further details on Corruption can be found at our entry [here](https://ourworldindata.org/corruption).

## Target 16.8

_**Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance.**_

Developing equal representation in international organizations between States is an important target of the United Nations. The charts below show the proportion of membership from developing countries across a range of international organizations, and the proportion of voting rights each country is allocated across such organizations.

## Target 16.9

_**By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.**_

An important indicator of the effectiveness of governance and institutional systems is the completeness of basic records, including birth and death registrations. Ensuring human, legal rights and justice for all requires the acknowledgement of all within official records. The chart below shows the completeness of birth registration across the world.
