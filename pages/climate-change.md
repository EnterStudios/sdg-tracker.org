title: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
goalNum: 13
name: Climate Action
description: >-
  Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to
  leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is
  quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other
  measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts.

  Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).


  The UN has defined 5 "Targets" and 8 "Indicators" for SDG 13. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.

            <h3>Economic losses from natural disasters</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Indicator 11.5.2 is the <i><q>direct economic loss in relation to global GDP, damage to critical infrastructure and number of disruptions to basic services, attributed to disasters</q></i>.<p>Direct economic losses from disasters are given at global and national levels in relative terms as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), and absolute terms of US$ per year.<p>Direct economic losses measures the monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area from natural disasters.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <i><q>By 2030, substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations</q></i>.</p>
