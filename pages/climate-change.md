title: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
goalNum: 13
name: Climate Action
description: >-
  Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to
  leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is
  quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other
  measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts.

## Target 13.1

**Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.**

Mitigating against climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be essential in the coming decades to meet our global climate targets and keep average global temperature rise within a 'safe' range. However, also crucial will lie in our ability to adapt to climate change impacts, and reduce the social costs of natural disasters (which are likely to be affected by climatic change).

The charts below track deaths, death rates and displacements from natural disaster events. Further statistics on Natural Catastrophes can be found at our entry [here](https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes).

Building resilience to natural disasters requires integrated policies at international, national and sub-national levels - particularly within cities with dense populations and vulnerable infrastructure. The chart below shows the number of countries with legislative or regulatory provisions for managing disaster risks.

## Target 13.2

**Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.**

Nations have committed within the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) [Paris Agreement](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php) to "strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius."

The chart below shows the number of parties within a range of multilateral environmental agreements - including the UNFCCC - by year. 

Commitments within the Paris Agreement vary by country, depending on their own submitted 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs). These must therefore be tracked on an individual basis. However, in the charts below we present data on total national carbon dioxide emissions, per capita emissions and the carbon intensity of economies. Further data on these topics are available at our entry on CO<sub>2</sub> and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
