title: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
goalNum: 13
name: Climate Action
description: >-
  Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to
  leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is
  quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other
  measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts.

## Target 13.1

_**Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.**_

Mitigating against climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be essential in the coming decades to meet our global climate targets and keep average global temperature rise within a 'safe' range. However, also crucial will lie in our ability to adapt to climate change impacts, and reduce the social costs of natural disasters (which are likely to be affected by climatic change).

The charts below track deaths, death rates and displacements from natural disaster events. Further statistics on Natural Catastrophes can be found at our entry [here](https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes).
