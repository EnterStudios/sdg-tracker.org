title: End poverty in all its forms everywhere
goalNum: 1
name: No Poverty
description: >-
  Extreme poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 1990. While this
  is a remarkable achievement, one in five people in developing regions still
  live on less than $1.90 a day, and there are millions more who make little
  more than this daily amount, plus many people risk slipping back into poverty.

## Target 1.1

_**By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day.**_

The chart below shoes the share of the total population living in extreme poverty by year. Extreme poverty is here defined by a $1.90 per day threshold, which has been corrected for inflation and cross-country differences in prices (i.e. given in purchasing power parity, PPP terms). This data is only measured countries defined as low or middle-income by World Bank definitions.

## **Target 1.2**

_**By 2030, reduce at least by half the share of the population living in poverty according to national definitions.**_

The chart below shows the share of the total population who are defined as living in poverty relative to the national poverty lines set by their own countries. National poverty lines are used for estimating poverty prevalence which is consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. 

The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and therefore doesn't provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. This data is only measured countries defined as low or middle-income by World Bank definitions â€” and for some countries in this category data on national poverty lines is not available (e.g. China and Brazil).

The chart below also differentiates this share living below national poverty lines by rural and urban populations. In general we see that the share living in poverty is higher in rural areas.

## Target 1.3

_**Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.**_

## Target 1.4

**_By 2030, ensure that everyone (particularly the poor and vulnerable) have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance._**

In the chart below we see the share of the total population with access to basic services, including an improved water source, electricity, sanitation facilities and clean cooking fuels. Access to improved water, sanitation, electricity and clean fuels are essential for health and wellbeing for disease prevention, nutrition, hygeiene and preventing deaths related to indoor air pollution.

## Target 1.5

_**By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.**_

## Target 1.a

**_Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions._**
