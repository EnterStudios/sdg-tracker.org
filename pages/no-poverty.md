description: >-
  Extreme poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 1990. While this
  is a remarkable achievement, one in five people in developing regions still
  live on less than $1.90 a day, and there are millions more who make little
  more than this daily amount, plus many people risk slipping back into poverty.
