  [Extreme poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty) rates have
  fallen by more than half since 1990. While this is a remarkable achievement,
  one-in-five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.90 a day.
  Millions more make little more than this daily amount and are at risk of
  slipping back into extreme poverty.


  Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG1) aims to eradicate extreme poverty by
  2030. The visualisations and data below present the latest data on our
  progress there.


  Longer-term trends, correlates and additional data on extreme poverty can be
  found at our entry [here](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty).
