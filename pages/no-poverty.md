  [Extreme poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty) rates have
  fallen by more than half since 1990. While this is a remarkable achievement,
  one-in-five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.90 a day.
  Millions more make little more than this daily amount and are at risk of
  slipping back into extreme poverty.


  Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG1) aims to eradicate extreme poverty by
  2030. The visualisations and data below present the latest data on our
  progress there.


  Longer-term trends, correlates and additional data on extreme poverty can be
  found at our entry [here](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty).

## Target 1.1

**By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day.**

The chart below shows the share of the total population living in extreme poverty by year. Extreme poverty is here defined by a $1.90 per day threshold, which has been corrected for inflation and cross-country differences in prices (i.e. given in purchasing power parity, PPP terms). This data is only measured countries defined as low or middle-income by World Bank definitions.

## Target 1.2

**By 2030, reduce at least by half the share of the population living in poverty according to national definitions.**

The chart below shows the share of the total population who are defined as living in poverty relative to the national poverty lines set by their own countries. National poverty lines are used for estimating poverty prevalence which is consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. 

The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and therefore doesn't provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. This data is only measured countries defined as low or middle-income by World Bank definitions â€” and for some countries in this category data on national poverty lines is not available (e.g. China and Brazil).

The chart below also differentiates this share living below national poverty lines by rural and urban populations. In general we see that the share living in poverty is higher in rural areas.

## Target 1.3

**Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.**

The charts below provide the latest data on coverage of social insurance programs, as well as the adequacy of these programs and unemployment benefits.

## Target 1.4

**By 2030, ensure that everyone (particularly the poor and vulnerable) have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.**

In the chart below we see the share of the total population with access to basic services, including an improved water source, electricity, sanitation facilities and clean cooking fuels. [Access to improved water](https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation), [sanitation](https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation#access-to-improved-sanitation), [electricity](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources#access-to-electricity) and [clean fuels](https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution#access-to-clean-fuels-and-technologies-for-cooking) are essential for health and wellbeing for disease prevention, nutrition, hygiene and preventing deaths related to [indoor air pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution).

## Target 1.5

**By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.**

The charts below visualise annual impacts of natural disaster events, including deaths, displacement and economic cost. Increasing resilience to the range of potential disaster events will be crucial for nations to reduce negative impacts of recurrent events as well as adapt to climate-related extremes.

## Target 1.a

**Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions.**

Reducing poverty and improving living standards for all will require significant financial investment in poverty-reducing policies, as well as in essential public services. The charts below show the share of governmental expenditure on healthcare and education, as well as the size of financial developmental assistance.
