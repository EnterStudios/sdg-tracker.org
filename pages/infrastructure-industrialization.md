  Investments in infrastructure – transport, irrigation, energy and information
  and communication technology – are crucial to achieving sustainable
  development and empowering communities in many countries. It has long been
  recognized that growth in productivity and incomes, and improvements in health
  and education outcomes require investment in infrastructure.

## Target 9.1

**_Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure._**

Developing high quality infrastructure - both within country and transboundary - is essential for both the movement of people and of goods for trade. These can have import impacts on economic growth and productivity trends. In the charts below you see the numbers of passenger and goods kilometres carried by different transport modes.

Further information on these topics can be found at our entries on [International Trade](https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade) and [Tourism](https://ourworldindata.org/tourism).

## Target 9.2

**_Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries._**

With economic growth, most countries move through a significant economic transition from agriculture to industrialisation. Ensuring this process of industrialisation is inclusive is essential in making such economic transitions sustainable, and closely linked with positive employment outcomes.

The charts below show the share of manufacturing, both with a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and in its share of total employment. Further information on
