  Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and
  foster innovation
goalNum: 9
name: 'Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure'
description: >-
  Investments in infrastructure – transport, irrigation, energy and information
  and communication technology – are crucial to achieving sustainable
  development and empowering communities in many countries. It has long been
  recognized that growth in productivity and incomes, and improvements in health
  and education outcomes require investment in infrastructure.


  The UN has defined 8 "Targets" and 12 "Indicators" for SDG 9. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
