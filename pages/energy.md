goalNum: 7
name: Affordable and Clean Energy
description: >-
  Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world
  faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or
  increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. 


  Transitioning the global economy towards clean and sustainable sources of
  energy is one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Sustainable
  energy is an opportunity â€“ it transforms lives, economies and the planet.

## Target 7.1

**By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.**

Modern energy services encompass both reliable provision to electricity, as well as access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking and heating. Electricity provides access to essential services such as light, technological and communication devices. Access to clean fuels for cooking is a key health indicator in reducing the burden of indoor air pollution (estimated to have resulted in [2.6 million premature deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution#deaths-from-indoor-air-pollution) in 2016).
