title: 'Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all'
goalNum: 7
name: Affordable and Clean Energy
description: >-
  Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world
  faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or
  increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. 


  Transitioning the global economy towards clean and sustainable sources of
  energy is one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Sustainable
  energy is an opportunity â€“ it transforms lives, economies and the planet.


  More information on energy access and sources can be found at the _Our World
  in Data_ entries on [Energy Production & Changing
  Sources](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources),
  [Renewables](https://ourworldindata.org/renewables), and [Fossil
  Fuels](https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels).


  The UN has defined 5 "Targets" and 6 "Indicators" for SDG 7. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
