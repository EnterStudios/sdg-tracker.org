title: 'Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources'
goalNum: 14
name: Life below Water
description: >-
  The UN explains: <i><q>Our oceans — their temperature, circulation, chemistry,
  and ecosystems  — play a fundamental role in making Earth habitable. 


  Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food,
  and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and
  regulated by the sea. Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital
  conduits for trade and transportation. Careful management of this essential
  global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future.</q></i>


  The UN has defined 10 _Targets_ and 10 _Indicators_ for SDG 14. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all <i>Targets</i> and show the data on the agreed <i>Indicators</i>.
