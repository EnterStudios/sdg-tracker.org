  Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food,
  and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and
  regulated by the sea. Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital
  conduits for trade and transportation. Careful management of this essential
  global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future.
